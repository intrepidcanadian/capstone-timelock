## Capstone Project

For the capstone project, I decided to add a time lock to adding liquidity to the pool.

This is because in the original repo for issuing points, points can be issued without the lock-up, allowing for abuse (i.e. people can add liquidity, remove, and add again).

The main change therfore is adding a hook "Hooks.BEFORE_REMOVE_LIQUIDITY_FLAG" to check if the lock-up period has elapsed before removing liquidity.
